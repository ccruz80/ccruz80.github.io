            <h2> For the Cake </h2>
            <ul>
               <li> 4 large eggs</li>
               <li> 1 cup sugar</li>
               <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
               <li>1/2 cup cornstarch or potato flour</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
               <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Make the sponge: Place the eggs and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat on high speed until pale and thickened. Properly whipped batter should be light and thick, and fall in a ribbon back into the bowl leaving trails of batter on the surface. 
            </p>
            <p>Set a timer for 5 minutes; the mixture should triple in volume. In a separate bowl, whisk the flours (or cornstarch), baking powder and salt together. Carefully fold the dry mixture into the egg mixture until thoroughly combined. 
            </p>
            <p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for about 27-30 minutes or until a toothpick tester comes out clean. Let the cake cool slightly in the pan for a few minutes then remove the springform collar. Peel away the parchment and let cool completely on a wire rack.
            </p>
            <h2>For the Vanilla Custard Pudding</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>1 cup whole milk,</li>
               <li>4 egg yolks,</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons corn starch,</li>
               <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar,</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract,</li>
            </ul>
            <p>  Stir together the milk, egg yolks, cornstarch, and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens. The minute the mixture starts to thicken, remove it from the heat source and whisk vigorously. Stir in the vanilla.
            </p>
            <p>
               Transfer to a bowl and let cool slightly. Press plastic wrap over the surface of the custard and refrigerate until firm. The chilled custard should be thick and hold in the bowl of a spoon.
            </p>
            <h2>Stabalized Whipped Cream</h2>
            <ul>
               <li> 1 envelope .25 oz. powdered unflavored gelatin</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
               <li>2 cups heavy cream, whipped</li>
               <li>4 cup powdered sugar</li>
               <li> teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
               <li>3 cup raspberry jam</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               Sprinkle the gelatin over the 2 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let stand until set. Place the heavy cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whip attachment. Set mixer speed to medium and beat until soft peaks form. 
            </p>
            <p> 
               Gradually add in the powdered sugar and then mix in the vanilla. Heat gelatin in the microwave for 5-7 seconds, or until completely liquid. Gradually add liquid gelatin to whipped cream in a thin stream with the mixer running. After all of the gelatin is added, increase mixer speed to high and beat to stiff peaks. Remove 1/2 cup of the whipped cream and set aside.
            </p>
            <h2> Assemble the cake </h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Powdered sugar for dusting</li>
               <li>1 lb. prepared marzipan</li>
               <li>Leaf green food color</li>
               <li>Ready made rose icing decorations I used Wilton</li>
               <li>Baker’s rose food color</li>
               <li>Clear extract any flavor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Torte the cake into three layers using a serrated knife. The layers will be very thin so do this carefully. Place the bottom cake layer on a plate or cake board. Spread on the raspberry jam. Top with 1/2 of the custard filling. Top with a second cake layer. Spread over the remaining 1/2 of custard.
            </p>
            <p> Pile all of the whipped cream on top and smooth into a dome shape using a large spatula. Place the final cake layer on top and press down so that all of the cake’s edges are smoothed against the whipped cream and a dome shape is formed. Cover with the reserved 1/2 cup of stabilized whipped cream.
            </p>

            <p>Prep and cover with marzipan: Dust a work surface with powdered sugar. Knead the marzipan with your hands to soften and place it on the work surface. Add a small amount of leaf green food color to the marzipan and knead in until a consistent green color is achieved. Lightly add powdered sugar as needed to prevent sticking. Roll it to a large circle, lifting to occasionally dust underneath with powdered sugar to prevent sticking. 
            </p>
            <p> Gently lay the marzipan circle over the top of the cake and use your hands to form the marzipan to the shape of the cake. Trim the excess marzipan from the bottom of the cake using a pizza or pastry wheel. Gently tuck the bottom edges of the marzipan under the cake using the back of a butter knife.
            </p>
            <p>Decorate: Paint the white Wilton candy roses with a little Baker’s Rose food color dissolved in clear extract. Use a kitchen-dedicated art brush with soft bristles so the food color can easily be brushed between the petals.

            <p>Tint leftover marzipan with a little more leaf green food color, and roll flat on a powdered sugar-dusted work surface. Cut small star-shaped flowers from the marzipan using a fondant cutter. Use leftover buttercream or a dot of corn syrup to attach the star shape to the bottom of the candy rose.
            </p>

            <p> Attach the rose to the top center of the cake using buttercream or a dot of corn syrup. Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar using a small sieve.
               The cake needs to be refrigerated at least one hour, or overnight is best. Keep chilled until serving time and any leftovers need to be refrigerated as well.

               Welcome to Nina's, a charming family-owned café that warmly welcomes not just humans but also our four-legged companions, both canine and feline. Nestled in the heart of our community, Nina's has been a beloved establishment since its inception in 2005. Founded by the Johnson family, whose love for animals inspired the unique vision of a cafe that caters not only to the diverse tastes of its human patrons but also extends a paw and a whisker to the furry members of our families.

               At Nina's, our story began when the Johnsons, passionate pet lovers and avid coffee enthusiasts, envisioned a space where families and their pets could gather, relax, and enjoy quality time together. Over the years, Nina's has evolved into a cherished meeting place for both two and four-legged friends, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Our mission at Nina's is to provide a cozy and inviting environment where everyone feels at home, be they human, canine, or feline. We are committed to serving not only delicious and thoughtfully crafted food and beverages for our human guests but also a carefully curated menu of pet-friendly treats that cater to the unique palates of our furry companions. Join us at Nina's, where the love for family, both two and four-legged, is at the heart of everything we do.

    <h3> UX evaluation and analysis </h3>
    <p> To test the theory that augmented reality affects how users shop, an observational study was conducted. One user was directed to complete 3 tasks using Amazonâ€™s augmented reality feature. First the user was instructed to look through three predetermined furniture listings of similar price and similar style. Afterwards they were instructed to click through all listings and use augmented reality on only one. Then they were instructed to add one listing by only looking at the pictures and disregarding all other information once the user added something to the ccart the study concluded.Below are some observations based on what the user did.  </p>

    <p> The participant spent two minutes and seventeen seconds deciding what product to add to the cart, for 47 seconds he reviewed the listings before selecting one.  When instructed to use the augmented reality feature the participant spent one minute and fifty seconds. When asked how he determined which listing he was going to use augmented reality feature on, the participant stated that he chose which one he would be most likely to buy first. The participant said that the augmented reality feature helped reassure him that he was making the right purchase.
